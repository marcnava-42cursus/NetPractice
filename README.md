# NetPractice

## Description

NetPractice is a networking training project developed by and for the 42 curriculum. Its purpose is to provide a practical environment to understand and apply fundamental networking concepts through a web-based interface.

The project consists of a series of progressive exercises focused on network configuration and analysis. Early levels address basic subnetting and IP addressing, while later levels introduce routing concepts. Each level requires the correct configuration of a network topology in order to validate the solution.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

The training interface is provided as part of the project resources. To run it, open the `index.html` file using a Chromium-based web browser. The interface does not function correctly on Firefox.

All required HTML files and assets are included in the project.

### Exporting Configurations

After completing a level, the network configuration must be exported using the **“Get My Config”** button available on the page. The configuration is exported in **JSON format**.

### Submission Requirements

A total of **10 exported configuration files**, one per level, must be placed at the **root of the Git repository** before submission.

### Networking Concepts Studied

This project focuses on understanding and applying core networking concepts. The first exercises are centered on IP addressing and subnetting, while later exercises introduce routing between networks. Through these levels, the following concepts are studied and applied:

- TCP/IP addressing: assigning valid IP addresses within a network  
- Subnet masks: defining network and host portions of an IP address  
- Default gateway: enabling communication between different networks  
- Routers: forwarding traffic between separate network segments  
- Switches: connecting devices within the same local network  
- OSI model and OSI layers: understanding network communication layers  
- Static routing: manually defining routes between networks  

I previously studied a vocational training program where I learned subnetting concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer. As a result, I was able to complete exercises 1 to 4 without consulting external resources, as the required concepts were already familiar.

For exercises 5 to 10, which introduce routing, I did not fully recall the necessary procedures. I researched the required concepts online, using AI-based tools as a research aid to obtain explanations of networking concepts and to analyze errors.

### Use of AI

 AI was used to understand where mistakes occurred and to receive step-by-step explanations of the correct processes.
